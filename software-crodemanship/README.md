 - You know better than the others
 - you don't need the others, they need you
 - Don't speak to people of your team, or your clients, or the ops, or else, they just slower you
 - Processes make all software better
 - Command and control is the better way to manage
 - Always rationnalise everything, 
 - Only looks for KPI, don't bowser to speak to the people
 - Always blindly follow the instruction, if something is wrong it's not your problem + you get more work after
